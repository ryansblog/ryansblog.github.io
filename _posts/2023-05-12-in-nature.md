My family and I live near a large park in the city. We frequent it all year long, but at this time of year the 'spring explosion' (as I like to call it) means there are plants and animals everywhere!

This was one of the several marmots we saw scurry away as we walked by last week. 

I was not able to capture any picutres of them, but earlier this week we witnessed a group of crows (murder?) pestering a larger bird. I believe it was a raven.

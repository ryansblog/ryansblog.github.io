My name is Ryan and this is my blog. 

It is sort of a mix between a journal & social media page. I have never been consistent about journaling, but I'd like to be. I am also tired of typical social media platforms. With this blog I can still write and share things but in a much more controlled setting. 

It remains to be seen what this becomes. For now, I am just getting started. 

### Maybe more a little later

I am working full-time and looking on complete my masters in the next year. After that, I expect to use my free time to really dive deeper into my interests. 

### Contact me

For now, find me on LinkedIn /RyanDrobny

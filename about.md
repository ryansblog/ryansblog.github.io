My name is Ryan and this is my blog. It's meant to be a sort of mixed form of journa & social media. I have never been consistent about old-fashioned journaling - but I'd like to be. I am also quite wary of the mainstream social media platforms. I much prefer to maintain my own content how I want and can share this space with others as I please. 

It remains to be seen what I do with this site. For now, I am just getting started. 

### A little later

Currently I am working full-time and working on completing my masters in the next year. After that I expect to use my free time to really dive deeper into my family and interests.
